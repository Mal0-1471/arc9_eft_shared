- Localized the UZI + UZI PRO, MTs-255 + VPO-215 & 101 and Special Useless Items packs
- Localization files no longer use "eftstring" table - they are now converted; Unconverted files precent in wank folder
	âˆŸ This has reduced the file size (for WS release) of all localization files by ~75% - ~40mb > ~10mb for all.
- Added localization strings for the Settings Menu
- Added a "ShellVolume" variable to the base; the sound volume for the shells was incredibly loud, so much so that they drowned out certain weapons' firing sound

If edits need to be made, consider using the localization files in "wank folder/localization/Unified/Input", applying the changes to all files, then running the bath files, copy+pasting the Output files into ARC9's localization folder.
