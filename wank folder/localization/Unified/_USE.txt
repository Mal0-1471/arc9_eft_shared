Grabs the "en.lua" table with EFT strings.
Then grabs the localizations in the "a-eftbulk.lua" file.
Then changes all localizations to "proper" localizations. Useful for those who want to alter the strings themselves, or want to make a community-made localization (madman).

Once localization is fully complete, this will be used to create the localization files properly.
